# Fullstack Review

## GOAL

As of right now there are only 3 pokemon displayed on the static mockup.html and none of the buttons are functioning. Implement the following functionality:


### Step 1

- Build out an express server to serve the front end.
- Create a script for starting the server and for webpack. Run both.
- Refactor your client to dynamically render from your React files.
- You will know if you have done this correctly if you see bulbasaur, ivysaur, venasaur.

### Step 2

- Using mongoDB, build out the back-end (establish connection, seed from pokemon.json)

### Step 3

- Create a GET route to display all the pokemon in your database on the page
- Filter the displayed pokemon to match the type selected in the dropdown menu
- Re-display all the pokemon on the page when 'Show All' is clicked

### Step 4

- On click of the pokemon's name, enable editing through an input field. On 'submit', your component should re-render so the updated name is displayed.

- Create a delete button to delete a pokemon. On click of the delete button, the pokemon should be removed from the page.

- Lastly, implement the 'Insert' button so you can add a pokemon to the list.


### Progress

- All pokemon displayed using MongoDB from step 3, need to implement filter functionality.
